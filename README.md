Issue:

1.  When attempting to use the align-items and justify-content properties to center a Bootstrap row class, there is no effect. However, the same styles applied in an SCSS file result in the desired centering effect.

2.  In web development, both Bootstrap and custom CSS are utilized, and there is uncertainty about how to strike a balance between the two. Seeking a suitable approach to seamlessly integrate the convenience of Bootstrap with the flexibility of custom CSS.

3.  Encountering intermittent challenges with Git source control, where there are instances of successful uploads, but at other times, the process gets stuck in an ongoing upload state.

4.  During the server deployment process, there is a recurring issue where fixed code remains on the server. Looking for an appropriate solution to address this problem.
